# LoRa-Module-with-Arduino-to-Establish-Communication-with-DHT11

This was a very simple project and can come in handy for various applications. But what it can't do is establish communication with the internet for modern-day IoT applications. So in this project, we will be using the HPD13A which is a SX1276 IC-based LoRa module to establish communication with the things network, so we can use this module for IoT-related applications.
